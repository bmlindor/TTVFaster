To compile:
gcc -o predict_formula predict_formula.c -lm -O3 -Wall
to run:
./predict_formula 2 test_ic2 0 1600 6 output_test_ic2
./executable    n_planets   param_file t0 tfinal jmax output_file


param_file format:
mstar m1 p1 e1*cos(arg peri1) i1 Omega1 e1*sin(arg peri1) TT1
+ repeat for remaining planets

Units are hardwired into predict_formula.c in the definition of G (global variable, at top) to be masses/solar masses distance/AU and time/day.

all angles are in radians

TT1 = the initial time of transit (according to the mean ephemeris). Make sure that your t0 in the input line matches the t0 your initial transits are refered to in the parameter file!

orbital elements are averaged orbital elements

inclinations do not enter the formula at all; they are in fact never used by the code. Omega is used only to determine the true anomaly of the planet at transit, according to the (hardwired) reference direction that at transit the true longitude is 0.0.

Hence Omega = -PI/2 and i=PI/2 implies an edge on orbit with the ascending node in the plane of the sky.

the output file is:
Planet # (zero based) Transit # (zero based) Transit time
